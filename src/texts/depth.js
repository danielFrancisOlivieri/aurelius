const depthText = `In Geek Love, Kathrynne Dunne writes, "I went over my old life with my new mind." A character has just had a secret revealed to her and she now understands her entire past in a different way. This is what I'm after. Seeing the familiar world in endless unfamiliar ways. That one life refigured over and over again so that I can see old realities in new ways. The day after Christmas, for example. I had received a book on the lexicon of architecture. Armed with words for architecture, I found I could notice what before I had seen hundreds of times. What had been mere background now distinguished itself as engaged columns, blind arches, rusticated quoins, addorsed or affronted statues, tympanum pediments. I could now read a new grammar out of the city around me. The world refigured in front of me. Newly immediate. Or when I finished a book on rhetoric. Advertisements now arrive to me in new ways. While I begin by noticing the elements I've been given words for chiasmus, Anadiplosis, anaphora, this new attention allows me to notice even the things whose adjoining terms I am not familiar with. I can go the other way if I want, from signified to signifier, but I rarely bother, as enjoyable as it is to find a word to grip the reality you have in front of you. But there's another kind of refiguring. This is the kind a voice gives you. Queaneu's Exercises in Style tells a single simple anecdote about a disagreement on a bus 100 different ways. Reading it, I realized that you could get another 100 versions out of 100 different people. Every consciousness is its own style, its own filter for reality. In my favorite novels I am agnostic to what happens. I am ready for anything as long as it's siphoned through the voice of Cheryl Glickman, Ishmael, or Ellison's Invisible Man. This is another way to pull new experience out of an old reality. In the first Toy Story movie, there is a scene where a toy maker updates Woody. He wears glasses with an array of auxiliary lenses which he can flick down in front of glasses' original lenses, presumably to amplify his view. This is the way I think about it. A way of adding lenses to your lens. The number of individual ways of viewing the world is extraordinary, but it increases with the near infinite power of a computorial explosion once you begin to combine them. Yes, I like to transform what I see, but also how I see it.`
